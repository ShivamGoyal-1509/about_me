## Projects
### 1. [Audio Deepfake Detection](https://github.com/ZouYang31/Audio-deepfake-detection/)
- This project focuses on developing robust and efficient methods to detect deepfake audio.
- By analyzing advanced attack strategies and utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning models, our work aims to strengthen the security and reliability of audio systems against deepfake threats.
  
### 2. [2D TO 3D RECONSTRUCTION OF MEDICAL IMAGES USING UNSUPERVISED GANs](https://github.com/WalnutEagle/EC-523-Deep-Learning-Project)
- This project explores unsupervised/weakly supervised learning techniques to reconstruct 3D medical images from biplanar 2D chest X-ray inputs.
- Experimented with multiple architectures to achieve this goal, including GANs, CNNs, and diffusion models.

### 3. [Comparing K-Means, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests for Datasets with Outliers and Missing Features](https://github.com/EC503-Project/ec503-project/)
- This project evaluates the performance of four machine learning techniques—K-Means, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests—on datasets containing outliers and missing features.
- The goal is to understand the robustness of these methods under varying data conditions and to analyze their strengths and weaknesses when applied to real-world scenarios.

### 4. [Temperature Prediction with Automated Trading](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal-1509/TempPrediction-with-Automated-Trading)
- Uses SVR to forecast next day's temperature.
- Executes automated trading strategies based on the anticipated temperature fluctuations.

### 5. [Facemoji – Emoji Prediction using Facial Expression Recognition](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal-1509/Facemoji)
- Predicts the mood of an individual using HAAR-CASCADE classifier and computer vision.
- Uses deep neural networks to predict a proper emoji while typing a sentence.

### 6. [Deafine: ASL Interpreter](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal-1509/ASL-Interpreter)
- Utilizes computer vision and CNN to interpret American Sign Language.

### 7. [GANs_MNIST_Dataset](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal-1509/GANs_MNIST_Dataset)
- Generates new MNIST handwritten digit datasets using Generator and Discriminator Models.

### 8. [Face Recognition with Indicators using OpenCV and Intel RealSense 435i Depth](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal-1509/Intel_RealSense_FaceRecog_Indicator)
- Uses Intel RealSense 435i for face recognition and Indicator Lights that turn green for 5 seconds after a face is detected.
- Employs OpenCV, pyrealsense2, Haar-Cascade, and multi-threading.

### 9. [Emoji Prediction Using NLP](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal-1509/Emoji-Prediction-Using-NLP)
- Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict the emoji of text

### 10. [COVID Prediction using Locally Weighted Regression](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal-1509/COVID-19-Prediction-using-Locally-Weighted-Regression)
- Uses Locally Weighted regression (LOWESS) to predict ceratin parameters of COVID 19 Pandemic.

### 11. [KNN & Decision Trees & Random-Forest](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal-1509/ionosphere-data-using-KNN-Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest)
- Uses the Ionosphere Dataset to help and understand the predictions and accuracies of different models such as K nearest neighbours (KNN), Decision Trees and Random Forests.

### 12. [Face Feature Recognition](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal-1509/Eye_and_Nose_Recognition_using_OpenCV)
- Uses the HAARCASCADE classifier to detect features of the human body.
- These features include Eyes and Nose of a human.
